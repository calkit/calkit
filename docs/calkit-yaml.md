# The `calkit.yaml` file

The `calkit.yaml` file serves as a small "database"
for the project's important metadata, which includes its:

- Global or system-level dependencies
  (applications, libraries, environmental variables)
- Questions the project seeks to answer
- Environments
- Datasets
- Figures
- Publications (journal articles, conference papers, presentations, posters)
- [Procedures](tutorials/procedures.md)
- [References](references.md)
- Subprojects (smaller projects executed as part of the main project)
- Calculations (ways to make predictions with the results)
- App (a way to allow users to interact with the results)

Objects can be imported from other projects,
which produces a chain of reference to allow tracking reuse
and reduce redundant storage.
