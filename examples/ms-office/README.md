# MS Office user

This example reflects the "non-hacker" researcher who uses Microsoft
Office (or similar) for a lot of their work.
Note that there is nothing wrong with this workflow,
but it is inherently harder for collaboration and reproducibility,
since version control for MS Office files is tougher.

Our goal with this example is to allow someone who likes Word and Excel
to keep using those tools, but to still help with organization
and reproducibility.
