# Installation

To install Calkit, [Git](https://git-scm.com) and Python must be installed.
If you want to use [Docker](https://docker.com) containers,
which is typically a good idea,
that should also be installed.
For Python, we recommend
[Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/).
If you're a Windows user and decide to install Miniforge or any other
Conda-based distribution,
e.g., Anaconda, you'll probably want to ensure that environment is
[activated by default in Git Bash](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/setting-up-conda-in-git-bash/534473).

After Python is installed, execute:

```sh
pip install calkit-python
```
