# Installation

To install Calkit, [Git](https://git-scm.com) and Python must be installed.
If you want to use [Docker](https://docker.com) containers,
which is typically a good idea,
that should also be installed.
For Python, we recommend
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

With uv installed, install Calkit with:

```sh
uv tool install calkit-python
```

Alternatively, but less ideally, you can install with your system Python:

```sh
pip install calkit-python
```

For Windows users, the
[Calkit Assistant](https://github.com/calkit/calkit-assistant)
app is the easiest way to get everything set up and ready to work in
VS Code, which can then be used as the primary app for working on
all scientific or analytical computing projects.
