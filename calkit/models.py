    Attributes
    ----------
    parent : str
        The project's parent project, if applicable. This should be set if
        the project was created as a copy of another. This is similar to the
        concept of forking, but unlike a fork, a child project's changes
        are not meant to be merged back into the parent.
        The format of this field should be something like
        {owner_name}/{project_name}, e.g., 'someuser/some-project-name'.
        Note that individual objects can be imported from other projects, but
        that doesn't necessarily make them parent projects.
        This is probably not that important of a distinction.
        The real use case is being able to trace where things came from and
        distinguish what has been newly created here.
