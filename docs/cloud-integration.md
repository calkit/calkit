## Cloud integration

The Calkit Cloud ([calkit.io](https://calkit.io)) serves as a project
management interface and a DVC remote for easily storing all versions of your
data/code/figures/publications, interacting with your collaborators,
reusing others' research artifacts, etc.

After signing up, visit the
[settings](https://calkit.io/settings?tab=tokens)
page and create a token for use with the API.
Then execute:

```sh
calkit config set token ${YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}
```
